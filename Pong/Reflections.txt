    // You will have  to click the screen to start the game. once the player clicks, the ball will randomnly float 
from the center to a random paddle. Alternate serves every two points.

    // The game does have an end. When any player reaches 10 points the game will end and it'll take you back to the start screen.

- What `if`s will there be?
    // If the ball hits a paddle it will bounce.
    If it hits the top or bottom of the canvas it will bounce
    If a player scores, the ball will automatically restart to its original position
