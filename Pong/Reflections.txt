They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. 
Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

- What are the conditions when the game begins? 
    // You will have  to click the screen to start the game. once the player clicks, the ball will randomnly float 
from the center to a random paddle. Alternate serves every two points. 

- Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
    // The game does have an end. When any player reaches 10 points the game will end and it'll take you back to the start screen.

### Events / Logic 
- What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
- How do those events affect the data of the program?
- For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
